      <p>My research focuses on twentieth-century Latin American literature, descriptive bibliography, book history, and questions of access and maintenance surrounding both digital and print cultures. Before coming to Princeton, I was a Digital Humanities Fellow in the Scholars’ Lab at the University of Virginia, where I developed a mapping and data visualization project that traces the role of publishers and printers in Jorge Luis Borges’s Argentina (1930-1951).</p>

      <p>As a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Center for Digital Humanities at Princeton I am working on a social network analysis project, “Global Networks of Cultural Production,” that seeks to explore the emergence of a transatlantic literary print culture in Argentina during the twentieth century, primarily through the efforts of Victoria Ocampo. Making use of Princeton’s extensive papers of Latin American writers and key figures in the publishing industry, this project not only reveals the intricate circuits of conversation, collaboration, and creation that blossomed in Argentina during this time, but also documents an archive of metadata about the physical aspects of the letters, magazines, journals, and other ephemera that link all of the involved intellectuals.</p>

      <p>I also am currently working on a monograph that considers the marked presence of books, periodicals, and other print mediums in Jorge Luis Borges’s life by analyzing the physical features of his publications, which she reads through the lens of analytical bibliography and material studies. In particular, I examine how each of his works were composed and circulated among diverse audiences, the publishers with whom he entered into contracts, his own level of bibliophilia, and how all of these factors influenced not only his formation as a writer, but also literary standards in Buenos Aires.</p>
